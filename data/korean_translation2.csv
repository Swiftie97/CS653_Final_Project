This is because the probability of developing Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease increases exponentially after the age of 65.","However, it is not only happy that life expectancy is extended. This is because as you turn 65, the chance of developing Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease increases exponentially.","But living longer isn't all sunshine and roses, as the chances of developing Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease increase exponentially after age 65."
"2050년, 80세가 넘은 미국의 인구만 약 3200만명 정도일 것입니다. 우리가 뭔가 조치를 취하지 않는다면, 그 중의 절반은 알츠하이머 병에 걸려있을 것이고, 300만명은 파킨슨 병에 걸려있을 것입니다.","By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it, half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.","In 2050, there will be approximately 32 million people in the United States over the age of 80.

오늘날 이렇게 치료가 불가능한 신경학적 질병에 매년 들어가는 돈만 약 3천억달러입니다.,"Right now, those and other neurologic diseases -- for which we have no cure or prevention -- cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.","Today, approximately $300 billion is spent each year on these incurable neurological diseases.","Today, about $300 billion is spent each year on such incurable neurological diseases.","Today, the cost of these incurable neurological diseases alone is approximately $300 billion annually."

알츠하이머 병은 일정한 모양으로 접혀야 하는 특정 단백질들이 제대로 접히지 않으면서 이상한 물질로 변하여 생기는 질병입니다.,Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein that should be folded up properly misfolds into a kind of demented origami.,Alzheimer's disease is a disease that occurs when certain proteins that are supposed to fold into a certain shape do not fold properly and turn into strange substances.,Alzheimer's disease is a disease caused by certain proteins that should be folded into a certain shape and turn into strange substances without folding properly.,Alzheimer's disease is caused by certain proteins that are supposed to fold into a certain shape not folding properly and turning into strange substances.
한가지 가능한 해결책은 분자 수준에서 그 단백질을 제대로 된 모양으로 만들어서 고정시켜주는 스카치 테이프 같은 역할을 하는 약을 개발하는 것이겠지요.,"So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs that function like molecular Scotch tape, to hold the protein into its proper shape.","One possible solution would be to develop a drug that acts like scotch tape at the molecular level, shaping the protein into the right shape and holding it in place.",One possible solution would be to develop a drug that acts like a scotch tape that shapes the protein into its shape and holds it in place at the molecular level.,"One possible solution would be to develop a drug that acts like Scotch tape, molding the protein into the right shape at the molecular level and holding it in place."
단백질의 구조가 뒤엉키면서 뇌의 각 부분을 파괴하는 과정이 멈출테니까요.,That would keep it from forming the tangles that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.,"As the protein structure becomes entangled, the process of destroying each part of the brain will stop.",The structure of the protein will become entangled and the process of destroying each part of the brain will stop.,"The protein's structure would tangle, and the process of destroying each part of the brain would stop."
"신기하게도, 뇌의 다른 부분에 영향을 주는 다른 신경학적 질병들도 잘못 접힌 단백질과 연관이 있다는 점이 뭔가 일반적인 해법이 나올 수 있음을 암시합니다. 알츠하이머 병 뿐만 아니라 다른 신경학적 질병들도 치료할 수 있는 방법이 될수도 있겠지요.","Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases which affect very different parts of the brain also show tangles of misfolded protein, which suggests that the approach might be a general one, and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases, not just Alzheimer’s disease.","Curiously, other neurological diseases affecting different parts of the brain have also been linked to misfolded proteins, suggesting that a general solution may be possible. It could be a way to treat not only Alzheimer's disease but also other neurological diseases.","Curiously, the fact that other neurological diseases affecting other parts of the brain are also linked to misfolded proteins suggests that there may be some general solution. It may be a way to treat not only Alzheimer's disease but also other neurological diseases.","Interestingly, other neurological diseases that affect different parts of the brain have also been linked to misfolded proteins, suggesting that there may be a common solution. This could be a way to treat not only Alzheimer's disease, but other neurological diseases as well."
이 이야기는 사실 암과도 관련되어 있습니다. 왜냐하면 신경학적 질병을 가진 사람들은 대부분의 암에는 잘 안 걸린다고 하거든요.,"There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here, because people with neurologic diseases have a very low incidence of most cancers.",This story is actually related to cancer as well.

Because people with neurological diseases are less likely to get most cancers.,"This story is actually related to cancer, because people with neurological diseases are said to be immune to most cancers."

"사실, 정부가 이 쪽 분야에 제대로 지원을 해주지 않아서 개인에 의지할 수 밖에 없게 된 것이죠. 좋은 상황은 아니죠.","And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here, because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.","In fact, the government did not provide proper support in this field, so we had no choice but to rely on individuals.

안녕하십니까?,Good morning.,hello?,How do you do?,Hello there.
역사상 가장 위대한 우상 중 한 명인 레오나르도 다빈치에 대하여 잠시 살펴보도록 하겠습니다.,"Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.","Let's take a quick look at one of history's greatest idols, Leonardo da Vinci.","Let's take a moment to look at one of the greatest idols of all time, Leonardo da Vinci.","Let's take a moment to look at one of history's greatest idols, Leonardo da Vinci."
"우리 모두는 그의 훌륭한 업적에 대해 잘 알고 있습니다. 그의 데생, 회화, 발명품, 그리고 글들.","We're all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.","We all know about his great achievements. His drawings, paintings, inventions, and writings.","We are all familiar with his great achievements. His drawings, paintings, inventions, and writings.","We all know of his great accomplishments: his life, his paintings, his inventions, and his writings."
하지만 우리는 그의 얼굴을 모릅니다.,But we do not know his face.,But we don't know his face.,But we don't know his face.,But we don't know his face.
"그에 대한 수많은 책들이 있지만, 그의 생김새에 대해서는 아직까지도 논란이 남아 있습니다.","Thousands of books have been written about him, but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.","There are numerous books written about him, but there is still controversy about his appearance.","There are many books about him, but there is still controversy about his appearance.","There are countless books written about him, but his appearance remains controversial."
심지어 이 유명한 초상화마저도 다수의 예술 역사학자들은 레오나르도 다빈치의 얼굴이 아니라고 합니다.,Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.,"Even this famous portrait is not the face of Leonardo da Vinci, according to many art historians.","Even this famous portrait is not the face of Leonardo da Vinci, according to many art historians.",Even this famous portrait is considered by many art historians not to be Leonardo da Vinci's face.
여러분은 어떻게 생각하십니까?,"So, what do you think?",What do you think?,What do you think?,What do you think?
이것이 레오나르도 다빈치의 얼굴일까요? 혹은 아닐까요?,Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?,Could this be the face of Leonardo da Vinci? Or maybe not?,Could this be Leonardo da Vinci's face? Or maybe not?,Could this be Leonardo da Vinci's face... or not?
함께 알아보도록 하죠.,Let's find out.,Let’s find out together.,Let's find out together.,Let's take a look.
다빈치는 그 주위의 모든 것을 그렸던 사람입니다.,Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.,Da Vinci is a man who painted everything around him.,Da Vinci is the one who painted everything around him.,Da Vinci was a man who painted everything around him.
"사람, 해부도, 식물, 동물, 풍경, 건축물, 물 등 보이는 모든 것을 그렸었죠.","He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.","I drew everything I saw: people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, architecture, and water.","I drew everything I saw: people, anatomical diagrams, plants, animals, landscapes, architecture, water, etc.","I drew everything I could see: people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, architecture, water, and more."
그런데 얼굴만큼은 예외였을까요?,But no faces?,But was the face an exception?,But was the face an exception?,But what about faces?
저로선 그걸 납득하기가 어렵더군요.,I find that hard to believe.,It was difficult for me to understand that.,It was hard for me to understand that.,It's hard for me to justify that.
그와 동시대에 살았던 다른 화가들은 여기 보시는 것처럼 얼굴을 그렸었습니다. 정면 그리고 7분신 초상화도 있죠.,"His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters.",Other artists who lived at the same time painted faces like you see here. There are also frontal and seven-body portraits.,Other painters who lived in his time painted faces as you can see here. There is also a front and a seven-person portrait.,"Other painters who lived at the same time as him painted faces like the one you see here. There's a frontal, and there's a seven-quarter portrait."
이 사실과 함께 다빈치가 매우 열정적인 화가였다는 점을 고려하면 다빈치는 분명히 자신의 초상화를 종종 그렸을 겁니다.,"So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time.","Considering this fact and the fact that da Vinci was a very passionate painter, he must have often painted his own portrait.","Considering that da Vinci was a very passionate painter along with this fact, da Vinci must have often painted portraits of himself.","This fact, combined with the fact that da Vinci was a very passionate painter, means that he must have often painted portraits of himself."
이제 그럼 그 초상화들을 찾아봅시다.,So let's try to find them.,Now let's find those portraits.,"Now, let's look for those portraits.",Now let's find those portraits.
만약 그의 작품들을 모두 살펴봐서 자화상이 될만한 것들만 뽑아낸다면 그의 얼굴을 발견할 수 있을지도 모릅니다.,"I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.","If you look through all of his works and pick out only those that could be self-portraits, you might be able to find his face.","If you look at all of his works and pick out only those that can be self-portraits, you might be able to find his face.","If you were to go through all of his works and pick out the ones that could be self-portraits, you might be able to spot his face."
그래서 저는 700개가 넘는 그의 작품들 중에서 남성 초상화들만 먼저 찾아냈습니다.,"So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700, and looked for male portraits.",So I first found only the male portraits among his more than 700 works.,So I found only male portraits among his more than 700 works.,"So, out of his 700+ works, I first found only male portraits."
여기 보시는 바와 같이 120개 정도가 나왔습니다.,"There are about 120, you see them here.","As you can see here, about 120 came out.","As you can see here, there were about 120 of them.","As you can see here, I came up with about 120."
이들 중에 어느 것들이 다빈치의 자화상일까요?,Which ones of these could be self-portraits?,Which of these are da Vinci's self-portraits?,Which of these are da Vinci's self-portraits?,Which one of these is Da Vinci's self-portrait?
일단 좀 전에 봤던 것처럼 정면 또는 7분신 초상화이어야만 합니다.,"Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.","First of all, as we saw earlier, it must be a frontal or seven-body portrait.","First of all, it must be a frontal or seven-person portrait as I saw before.","First of all, it must be a frontal or seven-pointed portrait, as we saw earlier."
따라서 옆면 초상화는 모두 제외할 수 있습니다.,So we can eliminate all the profiles.,So we can exclude all side portraits.,"Therefore, you can exclude all side portraits.",So you can exclude all side portraits.
그리고 충분히 상세하게 그려져있어야 합니다.,It also has to be sufficiently detailed.,And it must be drawn in sufficient detail.,And it must be drawn in sufficient detail.,And it should be drawn in sufficient detail.
그러므로 불분명하거나 지나치게 양식화된 그림들 역시 배제할 수 있습니다.,So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.,"Therefore, unclear or overly stylized pictures can also be excluded.","Therefore, unclear or overly stylized paintings can also be excluded.",So you can also rule out unclear or overly stylized pictures.
그리고 당시 사람들에 의하면 다빈치는 매우 잘 생기고 아름다운 남자였습니다.,"And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.","And according to people at the time, da Vinci was a very handsome and beautiful man.","And according to people at the time, da Vinci was a very handsome and beautiful man.","And according to the people of his time, da Vinci was a very handsome and beautiful man."
그러므로 추한 얼굴들 또는 풍자화들 또한 걸러낼 수 있습니다.,So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.,"Therefore, ugly faces or caricatures can also be filtered out.","Therefore, ugly faces or caricatures can also be filtered out.",So you can also filter out ugly faces or caricatures.
어떻게 되었나 보시죠. 조건을 충족하는 3개의 후보만이 남았습니다.,And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill.,Let's see what happened. There are only three candidates left that meet the criteria.,Let's see what happened. Only 3 candidates remain who meet the conditions.,Let's see what happened: we're down to three candidates that meet our criteria.
여기 보시는 바와 같습니다.,And here they are.,As you can see here.,As you can see here.,Here's what it looks like
아까 봤던 노인의 초상화도 포함돼 있고 다빈치의 유명한 펜 그림인 비트루비안 맨도 있습니다.,"Yes, indeed, the old man is there, as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.","It also includes the portrait of the old man we saw earlier, as well as da Vinci's famous pen drawing, the Vitruvian Man.","It also includes the portrait of an old man I saw earlier, as well as Da Vinci's famous pen painting, Vitruvian Man.","It includes the portrait of the old man we saw earlier, and da Vinci's famous pen drawing of the Vitruvian Man."
마지막으로는 다빈치가 그린 유일한 남자 초상화인 '음악가'도 있습니다.,"And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, ""The Musician.""","Lastly, there is also ‘The Musician’, the only portrait of a man painted by da Vinci.","Finally, there is also the only portrait of a man painted by Da Vinci, 'The Musician'.","Finally, there's The Musician, the only portrait of a man painted by da Vinci."
"각각의 얼굴을 살펴보기 전에, 왜 제가 이 주제에 대해 논할 자격이 있는지를 먼저 설명해야 할 것 같군요.","Before we go into these faces, I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.","Before we look at each face, I guess I should first explain why I am qualified to discuss this topic.","Before we look at each face, I think I should first explain why I deserve to discuss this topic.","Before we look at each face, I should probably explain why I'm qualified to discuss this topic."
"지금까지 제가 신문에 실은 초상화는 1,100 작품이 넘습니다. 지난 300, 아니 30년 동안 - 죄송합니다. 지난 30년 동안만 신문에 초상화를 실었습니다.","I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.","So far, I have published over 1,100 portraits in newspapers. For the last 300, no, 30 years - sorry. Only in the past 30 years have portraits been published in newspapers.","So far, I have published more than 1,100 portraits in newspapers. For the last 300, or even 30 years - sorry. Only in the last 30 years have they published portraits in newspapers.","To date, I've had over 1,100 portraits in newspapers. In the last 300, no, 30 years - sorry. I've only had portraits in newspapers for the last 30 years."
이렇게 많은 얼굴들을 그린 화가는 거의 없습니다.,"But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.",Few artists have painted so many faces.,Few painters have painted so many faces.,Few painters have ever painted so many faces.
그래서 경험상 저는 얼굴을 그리고 분석하는 것에 대해 조금은 알고 있습니다.,So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.,So from experience I know a little bit about drawing and analyzing faces.,"So, from experience, I know a little bit about drawing and analyzing faces.","So from experience, I know a little bit about drawing and analyzing faces."
본론으로 돌아와 이제 이 세 개의 초상화를 한 번 살펴보겠습니다.,"OK, now let's look at these three portraits.",Let's get back to the point and now take a look at these three portraits.,"Returning to the main topic, let's now take a look at these three portraits.","Now that we're back on topic, let's take a look at these three portraits."
"너무 놀라지 마세요. 확대해보면 세 얼굴은 모두 하나같이 넓은 이마, 옆으로 반듯이 누운 눈썹, 긴 코, 곡선을 그리는 입술, 그리고 작지만 잘 발달된 턱을 가지고 있는 것을 알 수 있습니다.","And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces, remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows, the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.","Don't be too surprised. If you zoom in, you can see that all three faces have the same wide forehead, sideways eyebrows, a long nose, curved lips, and a small but well-developed chin.","Don't be too surprised. If you zoom in, you can see that all three faces all have a wide forehead, sideways eyebrows, a long nose, curved lips, and a small but well-developed chin.","Don't be too surprised. If you zoom in, you'll notice that all three faces have the same broad forehead, side-set eyebrows, long nose, curved lips, and small but well-developed chin."

한 칵테일 파티에서 멋진 아이디어가 떠올라서 시작했어요. 사실은 자꾸만 생각이 나더라고요.,"And it started, as with many great ideas, or many ideas you can't get rid of anyway, at a cocktail party.","It all started because I had a great idea at a cocktail party.

그래서 만들었어요.,So I did.,So I made it.,That's why I made it.,So I made one.
제가 까마귀에 대해 흥미를 갖게 된 이유의 하나는 인간의 거주지가 넓어진 까닭에 많은 종들이 멸종하고 있다는 사실이 널리 알려져 있음에도 불구하고 생존을 위해 고군분투하고 있는 이런 다른 종들에 대해 아무도 신경을 쓰는것 같지 않았기 때문입니다.,"But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion, and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving.","One of the reasons I became interested in crows was because it was widely known that many species were becoming extinct due to the expansion of human habitation, but no one seemed to care about these other species struggling to survive.","One of the reasons I became interested in crows was that no one seemed to care about these other species struggling to survive, even though it was widely known that many species were becoming extinct due to the expansion of human habitation.","One of the reasons I became interested in crows is because it's widely known that many species are going extinct due to the expansion of human habitation, yet no one seems to care about these other species that are struggling to survive."
"특히 우리가 주변에서 흔히 볼 수 있는 종들에 대해 말씀 드리고 싶습니다. 인간 세계에 적응한 쥐, 바퀴벌레, 까마귀 같은 종들 말입니다.","And I'm talking specifically about synanthropic species, which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies, species like rats and cockroaches and crows.","In particular, I would like to talk about species that we commonly see around us.

Species such as mice, cockroaches, and crows that have adapted to the human world.","In particular, I'm talking about species that we see all around us: rats, cockroaches, and crows that have adapted to the human world."
이들을 잘 관찰해 보니까 우리 인간의 삶에,"And as I started looking at them, I was finding that they had hyper-adapted.","As I observed them carefully, I realized that they are a part of our human lives.","If you observe them carefully, you will see that they have a significant impact on our human lives.","If you observe them closely, you'll notice that we humans have"
거의 완벽하게 적응해서 살아가고 있었습니다.,They'd become extremely adept at living with us.,I had adapted to life almost perfectly.,I was living with almost perfect adaptation.,I had adapted almost perfectly.
그 보답으로 우리는 그들을 죽이려고만 했고요.,"And in return, we just tried to kill them all the time.","In return, we just tried to kill them.","In return, we only tried to kill them.","In return, all we did was try to kill them."
"그렇기 때문에 그들은 일방적으로 우리에 기생할 수 밖에 없었고,","And in doing so, we were breeding them for parasitism.",That is why they had no choice but to unilaterally become parasites on us.,"Therefore, they had no choice but to parasitize on us unilaterally,","That's why they unilaterally parasitized on us,"
우리와 살아가기 위한 새로운 생존 방법을 계속해서 찾아내야 했습니다.,We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways.,We had to keep finding new ways to survive to survive among us.,We had to continue to find new ways to survive with us.,We had to keep finding new ways to survive.
쥐나 바퀴벌레의 엄청난 번식력이 그 일례입니다.,"So, for example, rats are incredibly responsive breeders.",An example is the enormous reproductive capacity of rats and cockroaches.,An example is the enormous fertility of mice and cockroaches.,An example of this is the prodigious fecundity of rats and cockroaches.
바퀴벌레를 박멸하려고 해보신 분들은 잘 아시겠지만 금세 우리가 사용하는 살충제에 대한 엄청난 면역력을 갖게 되잖아요.,"And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows, have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.",Anyone who has tried to eradicate cockroaches knows well that they quickly develop tremendous immunity to the pesticides we use.,"As those of you who have tried to eradicate cockroaches know, they quickly develop tremendous immunity to the pesticides we use.","If you've ever tried to exterminate cockroaches, you know that they quickly develop a huge immunity to the pesticides we use."
그래서 상호 이득이 되는 관계를 구축하고 싶었습니다.,"So, I thought, let's build something that's mutually beneficial.",So I wanted to build a mutually beneficial relationship.,So I wanted to build a mutually beneficial relationship.,So we wanted to build a mutually beneficial relationship.
양측이 서로에게 이익이 되는 새로운 관계를 만들 수 있는 방법을 찾아보자는 겁니다.,"Well, then let's build something that we can both benefit from, and find some way to make a new relationship with these species.",The idea is to find a way to create a new relationship that benefits both sides.,Let's find a way for both parties to create a new relationship that benefits both parties.,Let's find a way to create a new relationship where both sides benefit.
그래서 이 자판기를 만들었습니다.,And so I built the vending machine.,So I made this vending machine.,So I made this vending machine.,So we created this vending machine.
그런데 까마귀에 대해서 잘 아시면 이 자판기 얘기가 더 재미있어집니다.,But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows.,"But if you know a lot about crows, this vending machine story becomes more interesting.","However, if you know more about crows, this vending machine story becomes more interesting.","But if you know anything about crows, this vending machine story gets even more interesting."
알고 보니 까마귀가 인간 거주 환경에 잘 적응할 뿐 아니라 무척 번성하고 있다는 사실을 발견했지요.,It turns out that crows aren't just surviving with human beings -- they're actually really thriving.,"It turns out that crows are not only adapting well to human habitation, but are thriving.","It turned out that crows not only adapt well to human habitation, but also thrive very well.","As it turns out, crows are not only well adapted to human habitation, they're thriving."

우리가 신경을 쓰든 안 쓰든 까마귀들은 항상 우리 주변에 살고 있어요.,"So we may not think about them, but they're always around.","Whether we pay attention to it or not, crows are always around us.","Whether we care or not, crows are always living around us.","Whether we pay attention or not, crows are always around us."
"놀라울 것도 없지만, 현재 전체 인구의 절반 이상이 도시에 거주하고 있고,","And not surprisingly, given the human population growth, more than half of the human population is living in cities now.","Not surprisingly, more than half of the total population now lives in cities.","It's not surprising, but more than half of the total population now lives in cities,","Not surprisingly, more than half of the world's population now lives in cities,"

우리 주변의 까마귀 수가 급격히 증가하는 것은,We're seeing a population boom with crows.,The rapid increase in the number of crows around us is,The rapid increase in the number of crows around us,The dramatic increase in the number of crows around us is a result of the
조류 개체수가 기하급수적으로 늘어나고 있다는 것을 보여줍니다.,So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers.,It shows that bird populations are growing exponentially.,It shows that the bird population is growing exponentially.,It shows that the bird population is growing exponentially.
그러니 까마귀가 많이 보이는 것이 당연하지요.,So that's no great surprise.,So it’s natural to see a lot of crows.,So it's only natural that you can see a lot of crows.,So it's no wonder you see so many crows.
그보다 제가 진짜 흥미롭게 여기는 것은 까마귀의 독특한 적응 방법에 있습니다.,But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.,"Rather, what I find really interesting is the crow's unique way of adapting.",What I find really interesting is the crow's unique adaptation method.,But what I really find interesting is the unique adaptation of the crow.
한 가지 예를 들어볼게요.,And I'll give you an example of that.,Let me give you an example.,Let me give you an example.,Here's an example.

하지만 문제는 여기서 시작됩니다.,But the researchers had a problem.,But the problem starts here.,But that's where the problem begins.,But the problem starts here.
누군가 실수로 철사 한 조각을 남겼습니다.,They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there.,Someone accidentally left a piece of wire behind.,Someone accidentally left a piece of wire.,Someone accidentally left a piece of wire behind.
베티는 철사로 이런 경험을 해본 적이 없거든요.,And she hadn't had the opportunity to do this before.,Betty has never experienced anything like this with wire.,Betty has never had this experience with a wire.,Betty has never done this with wire before.
보세요. 잘 안 되죠.,"You see, it wasn't working very well.",look. It doesn't work.,Look at. It doesn't work.,Try this. It doesn't work.
하지만 바로 적응했습니다.,So she adapted.,But I adapted right away.,But I adapted right away.,But I adapted right away.
이건 전혀 예상하지 못한 결과입니다. 이런 걸 본 적이 없어요.,Now this is completely unprompted. She had never seen this done before.,This is a completely unexpected result. I've never seen anything like this.,This is a completely unexpected result. I've never seen anything like this.,"This is totally unexpected, I've never seen anything like this before."

바로 이 부분에서 연구자들이 까무라쳤어요.,That's the part where the researchers freak out.,This is exactly where researchers got lost.,This is where the researchers were confused.,That's where the researchers hit the nail on the head.
연구하면 할수록 까마귀가 정말 똑똑하다는 걸 알 수 있었습니다.,"So, it turns out we've been finding more and more that crows are really, really intelligent.","The more I studied it, the more I realized that crows are really smart.","The more I studied, the more I realized that crows are really smart.","The more I studied them, the more I realized that crows are really smart."

한 예로 스웨덴 까마귀들은 낚시꾼이 얼음 구멍에 낚시줄을 드리울 때까지 기다렸다가,"For example, in Sweden, crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice.","For example, Swedish crows wait for an angler to drop a fishing line into a hole in the ice.","For example, Swedish crows wait for the angler to cast their line in the ice hole.","For example, Swedish crows wait for an angler to cast a line through a hole in the ice, and then they use the"

전혀 다른 예로 수년 전 워싱턴 대학에서 있었던 일입니다. 구내 까마귀 몇 마리를 잡아서 실험을 진행하는 팀이 있었습니다.,"On an entirely different tack, at University of Washington, they, a few years ago, were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus.",A completely different example occurred several years ago at the University of Washington.

몇몇 학생이 그물로 까마귀 몇 마리를 잡아와서 무게와 크기를 재는 등 귀찮게 하고 다시 풀어주었습니다.,"Some students went out and netted some crows, brought them in, and were -- weighed them, and measured them and whatnot, and then let them back out again.","Some students caught some crows with a net, measured their weight and size, and released them again.","Some students caught a few crows with a net, weighed and sized them, and then released them again.","A few students caught a few crows with a net, weighed and measured them, and released them back into the wild."
그 후에 발견한 재밌는 점이 그 주 내내 실험을 진행한 학생들이 지나갈 때마다 그 까마귀들이 까악거리며 주변을 맴돌고 귀찮게 굴더라는 겁니다.,"And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week, these crows, whenever these particular students walked around campus, these crows would caw at them, and run around and make their life kind of miserable.","An interesting thing I discovered after that was that every time the students who were conducting the experiment passed by throughout the week, the crows would caw, hover around, and be annoying.","The funny thing I found after that was that every time the students who conducted the experiment passed by, the crows were wrinkling around and bothering them.","The funny thing I noticed afterward was that throughout that week, whenever the students who were doing the experiment walked by, those crows would cackle and hover around them and bother them."

이제 까마귀가 똑똑하다는 사실은 분명해졌습니다. 하지만 연구하면 할수록 그들의 적응력은 더 굉장하다는 게 드러났습니다.,"So we know that these crows are really smart, but the more I dug into this, the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation.","Now it's clear that crows are smart.

"글세요, 제 생각에 현대 언어의 역사는... 서유럽의 동굴 벽화나 판각, 조각, 춤의 흔적... 같은 것들 보다는 더 오래 전 이야기 같아요 3만 5천년 이상된 구석기시대 말이죠","Murray Gell-Well, I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe, in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.","Well, I think the history of modern language goes back much further than the cave paintings, engravings, sculptures, and dance traces of Western Europe, dating back more than 35,000 years to the Paleolithic Age.","Write, I think the history of modern languages is...

"하지만 오늘날의 언어들 중 대부분 혹은 모두가 더 후세기의 어떤 언어, 즉 약 2만년 전의 단일 언어에서 전해졌다는 가정도 맞을 수 있어요 병목기간 이라고 부르는 시기이지요","But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years, or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.","However, it may also be correct to assume that most or all of today's languages ​​descended from some much later language, a single language from about 20,000 years ago, a period called the bottleneck period.","However, it can be assumed that most or all of today's languages were transmitted from some language from a later century, that is, a single language about 20,000 years ago, which is called the bottleneck period","But it's also reasonable to assume that most or all of today's languages came from some later language, a monolingual language about 20,000 years ago, a period we call the bottleneck period."
