It's also what gets kids to understand and fall in love with rocket science, and then they realize the importance of physics and math, which in turn makes them realize the greatness of the unknown explorers who came before them.",-0.3007240295410156,0.73651123046875,-0.2924938797950744,0.7431870698928833,-0.2209247350692749,0.7777239680290222,0.75848985,0.753971,0.7524354,0.4543309686641841,0.4860049493191668,0.48352633103144677
